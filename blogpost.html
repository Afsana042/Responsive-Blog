            <p>Outside of my daily responsibilities leading a team of software engineers at J.P. Morgan, I appreciate the numerous opportunities our firm provides our technologists to give back in our local communities.</p>
            <p>As part of J.P. Morgan's volunteerism efforts, we partner with Fundación Pescar, a Buenos Aires-based nonprofit whose primary objective is to equip individuals coming from vulnerable communities with career skills. We recently worked with Fundación Pescar to provide a six-month software development training program called Paths to the Future, which brought new learning opportunities to 300 young women interested in launching a career in technology.</p>
            <p>I was lucky enough to undertake two data-centric roles throughout my time in the Graduate Program. One with a data engineering lean, and the other with a focus on data science. During my five-month rotation with the Data Science team, I was asked whether, hypothetically, I would be interested in staying on once my rotation ended. I answered with a resounding, un-hypothetical, “yes”. I was offered a permanent role, and on February 13 my Slack title ticked over from Graduate Developer to Associate Machine Learning Engineer. I now have the privilege of working each day with a team that appreciates a good excel spreadsheet as much as I do.

              <p> Our team is responsible for the data that helps drive consumer personalisation. We work with big data sets, and use machine learning algorithms to find trends and patterns. The biggest shock for me was just how much data we have access to, and how we manage to clean and sort that data into useful pieces of information. It’s like walking into a supermarket, and being asked to find the ingredients to bake a cake… but with no signs on the aisles and no recipe to follow! It’s been fascinating, and at times overwhelming, to learn about all the different techniques used to make sense of data, and to see the impact that our work can have on the business.

                For me, no two days at REA look quite the same. Depending on the piece of work I’m currently on, my day-to-day might involve writing SQL in BigQuery, training models in Jupyter Notebook or deploying them through AWS Sagemaker. Tools like Data Studio are good for data visualisation, and I’m still learning my way around Tableau. Breeze is an REA tool built off of Airflow, which we use to move data across the company, and for most of my code editing I use Visual Studio Code. For workflow and team management we use Trello and Miro, and for personal productivity I use Notion, Stack Overflow and, most importantly, Spotify rain sounds.</p>
